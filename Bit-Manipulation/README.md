* __[BIT DIFFERENCE](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Bit-Manipulation/Bit-Difference.js)__

    You are given two numbers A and B. The task is to count the number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

    ```CPP
    Input : a = 10, b = 20
    Output: 4

    Explanation: 
    a = 01010
    b = 10100

    As we can see, the bits of A that need to be flipped are 01010. If we flip these bits, we get 10100, which is B.
    ```

* __[SET BITS COUNT](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Bit-Manipulation/Set-Bits-Count.cpp)__

    Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

    ```CPP
    Input : N = 6
    Output: 2
    ```
