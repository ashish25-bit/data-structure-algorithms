* __[MINIMUM SUM](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Heap/Minimum-Sum.cpp)__

    Design a data-structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop() and an additional operation getMin().
    __NOTE: EVERY OPERATION SHOULD BE O(1).__
    1. push(x) 
       1 10
    2. pop()
       2
    3. getMin()
       3
    
    
    ```CPP
    ```

* __[FIND MEDIAN IN A STREAM](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Heap/Find-Median-In-A-Stream.cpp)__
   
   Given an input stream of N integers. The task is to insert these numbers into a new stream and find the median of the stream formed by each insertion of X to the new stream.

   ```CPP
      Input : N = 4
              X[] = 5, 15, 1, 3
      Output: 5 10 5 4
   ```
