* __[SPECIAL STACK](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Stack/Special-Stack.cpp)__

    Design a data-structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop() and an additional operation getMin().
    __NOTE: EVERY OPERATION SHOULD BE O(1).__
    1. push(x) 
       1 10
    2. pop()
       2
    3. getMin()
       3
