* __[COMMON ELEMENTS](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Common-Elements-3-Array.cpp)__
    Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.

    There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.

    ```CPP
    Input: n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
           n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
           n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
    Output: 20 80
    ```

* __[FND THE DUPLICATE NUMBER](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Duplicate-Element(Only-One).cpp)__
    Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

    There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.

    ```CPP
    Input: nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
    Output: 2
    ```

* __[MIN MAX ELEMENT](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Min-Max-Element.cpp)__
    Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons

    ```CPP
    Input  : arr[] = { 1000, 11, 445, 1, 330, 3000 }
    Output : Minimum element is 1
             Maximum element is 3000
    ```

* __[NEGATIVE ELEMENTS ONE SIDE](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Negative-One-Side.cpp)__
    Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space.

    ```CPP
    Input  : arr[] = { 1000, 11, 445, 1, 330, 3000 }
    Output : Minimum element is 1
             Maximum element is 3000
    ```

* __[REVERSE AN ARRAY](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Reverse.cpp)__
    Write a program to reverse an array or string

    ```CPP
    Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
    Output : arr[] = {3, 2, 1}
    ```

* __[ONE CYCLIC ROTATION](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/One-Cyclic-Rotation.cpp)__
    Given an array, cyclically rotate an array by one.

    ```CPP
    Input  : 8
             9 8 7 6 4 2 1 3
    Output : 3 9 8 7 6 4 2 1
    ```

* __[SORT012](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Sort012.cpp)__
    Given an array A of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; you need to sort the array in ascending order without using a sorting algo.

    ```CPP
    Input  : 5
             0 2 1 2 0
    Output : 0 0 1 2 2
    ```

* __[UNION AND INTERSECTION OF TWO  ARRAYS](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Array/Union-Intersection-Sorted-Array.cpp)__
    Given an array A of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; you need to sort the array in ascending order without using a sorting algo.

    ```CPP
    Input  : arr1: 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6
             arr2: 2, 2, 3, 5, 7
    Output : Union Array: 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
             Intersection Array: 2 5
    ```
