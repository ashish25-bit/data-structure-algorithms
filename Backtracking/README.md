* __[ALL POSSIBLE PATHS RIGHT AND DOWN MOVEMENTS](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Backtracking/All-Possible-Path(Right-Bottom-Movement).cpp)__
    
    The problem is to print all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.

    ```CPP
    Input  : 1 2 3
             4 5 6
             
    Output : 1 4 5 6
             1 2 5 6
             1 2 3 6
    ```
