    Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value.
    
    ```CPP
    Input: N = 5
           Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7} 
    Output: 2
    ```

* __[SQUARE ROOT OF AN INTEGER](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/Square-Root-Of-An-Integer.cpp)__

    Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.

    ```CPP
    Input: N = 9
    Output: 2
    ```
