* __[FIND MISSING AND REPEATING ELEMENT](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/Find-Missing-Repeating.cpp)__

    Given an unsorted array arr of size n of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

    ```CPP
    Input: n = 2
           arr[] = {2, 2}
    Output: Repeating: 2 Missing: 1
    ```

* __[FIRST AND LAST OCCURENCE OF X](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/First-And-Last-Occurrences-Of-Xcpp)__

    Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.

    ```CPP
    Input:  n = 9 x = 5
            arr[] = {1 3 5 5 5 5 67 123 125}
    Output: 2 5

    Input:  n = 9 x = 7
            arr[] = {1 3 5 5 5 5 7 123 125}
    Output: 6 6

    Input:  n = 9 x = 5
            arr[] = {1 3 4 4 4 4 67 123 125}
    Output: -1
    ```

* __[FIXED POINT](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/Fixed-Point.cpp)__

    Given an array arr of n positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value.

    ```CPP
    Input: n = 5
           arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 5}
    Output: 2 5
    ```

* __[MAJORITY ELEMENT](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/Majority-Element.cpp)__

    Given an array arr of n elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array arr of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times in the array.

    ```CPP
    Input: n = 5
           arr = 3 1 3 3 2
    Output: Majority Element: 3

    Input: n = 3
           arr = 1 2 3
    Output: No Majority Element
    ```

* __[SEARCH IN A ROTATED ARRAY](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/Search-In-Rotated-Sorted-Array.cpp)__

    You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order of size n, and an integer target.

    ```CPP
    Input:  n = 7
            nums = 4 5 6 7 0 1 2
            target = 0
    Output: 4
    ```

* __[SQUARE ROOT OF AN INTEGER](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Searching-Sorting/Square-Root-Of-An-Integer.cpp)__

    Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.

    ```CPP
    Input: N = 9
    Output: 2
    ```
