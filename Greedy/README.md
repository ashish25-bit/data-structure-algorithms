* __[FIND MAXIMUM SUM POSSIBLE](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/Find-Maximum-Sum-Possible.js)__

    Given three stacks of the positive numbers, the task is to find the possible equal maximum sum of the stacks with the removal of top elements allowed. Stacks are represented as an array, and the first index of the array represent the top element of the stack.

    ```CPP
    Input : stack1[] = { 3, 2, 1, 1, 1 }
            stack2[] = { 4, 3, 2 }
            stack3[] = { 1, 1, 4, 1 }
    Output: 5
    ```

* __[JOB SEQUENCING PROBLEM](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/Job-Sequencing-Problem.cpp)__

    Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated to it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. The task is to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.

    ```CPP
    Input : N = 4
            Jobs = (1,4,20)(2,1,10)(3,1,40)(4,1,30)
    Output: 2 60

    Input : N = 5
            Jobs = (1,2,100)(2,1,19)(3,2,27)(4,1,25)(5,1,15)
    Output: 2 127

* __[HUFFMAMAN CODING](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/Huffmann-Coding.cpp)__

    Given An array of Alphabets and their frequency. Your task is to print all the given alphabets Huffman Encoding.

    ```CPP
    Input : abcdef
            5 9 12 13 16 45
    Output: 0 100 101 1100 1101 111

* __[N MEETINGS IN A ROOM](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/N-Meetings-In-One-Room.cpp)__

    There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of (S[i], F[i]) where S[i] is start time of meeting i and F[i] is finish time of meeting i.

    What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room? Also note start time of one chosen meeting can't be equal to the end time of the other chosen meeting.

    ```CPP
    Input : N = 6
            S[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5}
            F[] = {2,4,6,7,9,9}
    Output: 1 2 4 5
    ```

* __[REARRANGE CHARCTERS](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/Rearrange-Characters.cpp)__

    Given a string S with repeated characters (only lowercase). The task is to rearrange characters in a string such that no two adjacent characters are same.

    ```CPP
    Input : geeksforgeeks
    Output: 1

    Input : bbbbb
    Output: 0
    ```
