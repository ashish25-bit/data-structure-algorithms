* __[JOB SEQUENCING PROBLEM](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/Job-Sequencing-Problem.cpp)__
    Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated to it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. The task is to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.

    ```CPP
    Input : N = 4
            Jobs = (1,4,20)(2,1,10)(3,1,40)(4,1,30)
    Output: 2 60

    Input : N = 5
            Jobs = (1,2,100)(2,1,19)(3,2,27)(4,1,25)(5,1,15)
    Output: 2 127
    ```

* __[N MEETINGS IN A ROOM](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/N-Meetings-In-One-Room.cpp)__
    There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of (S[i], F[i]) where S[i] is start time of meeting i and F[i] is finish time of meeting i.

    What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room? Also note start time of one chosen meeting can't be equal to the end time of the other chosen meeting.

    ```CPP
    Input : N = 6
            S[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5}
            F[] = {2,4,6,7,9,9}
    Output: 1 2 4 5
    ```
