* __[DUPLICATE IN STRINGS](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Strings/DuplicateInString.cpp)__

    Write an efficient program to print all the duplicates and their counts in the input string.

    __NOTE:__ Output of this will in alphabetical order. 
    
    ```CPP
    Input: bbaaffccd
    Output: a: 2
            b: 2
            c: 2
            f: 2
    ```

* __[DUPLICATE IN STRINGS 2](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Strings/DuplicateInString2.cpp)__

    Write an efficient program to print all the duplicates and their counts in the input string.
    
    __NOTE:__ Output of this will not be alphabetically, but in order in which string is inputted.
    
    ```CPP
    Input: bbaaffccd
    Output: b: 2
            a: 2
            f: 2
            c: 2
    ```

* __[EQUAL 0s 1s](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Strings/Equal-0s-1s.js)__

    Given a binary string str of length N, the task is to find the maximum count of substrings str can be divided into such that all the substrings are balanced i.e. they have equal number of 0s and 1s.
    
    ```CPP
    Input: 0100110101
    Output: 4
    ```
    ```

* __[PALINDROME STRING](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Strings/Palindrom-String.cpp)__

    Given a string S, check if it is palindrome or not.
    
    ```CPP
    Input: S = abba
    Output: abba is palindrome
    ```
    ```

* __[PRINT ALL SENTENCES](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Strings/Print-All-Sentences.js)__

    Given a list of word lists How to print all sentences possible taking one word from a list at a time via recursion.
    
    ```CPP
    Input : {
                {"you", "we"},
                {"have", "are"},
                {"sleep", "eat", "drink"}
            } 
    Output: "you have sleep"
            "you have eat"
            "you have drink"
            "you are sleep"
            "you are eat"
            "you are drink"
            "we have sleep"
            "we have eat"
            "we have drink"
            "we are sleep"
            "we are eat"
            "we are drink"
    ```
    ```

* __[REVERSE STRING](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/Strings/Reverse-String.cpp)__

    Write a function that reverses a string.
    
    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
    
    ```CPP
    Input: hello
    Output: olleh
    ```
    ```
