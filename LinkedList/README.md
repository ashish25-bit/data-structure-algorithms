* __[ADD TWO NUMBERS](https://github.com/ashish25-bit/data-structure-algorithms/blob/master/LinkedList/Add-Two-Numbers.cpp)__
    
    Given two numbers represented by two linked lists(THE NUMBERS IN THE LIST ARE IN REVERSE ORDER).
    The task is to return a sum list. The sum list is a linked list representation of the addition of two input numbers.

    ```CPP
    Input: l1 = {2-> 4-> 3} { 342 }
           l1 = {5-> 6-> 4} {465}
    Output: 7-> 0-> 8 {807}
    
    Input: l1 = {9-> 9} {99}
           l1 = {0-> 1} {10}
    Output: 9-> 0-> 1 {109}

    Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create a new list representing the intersection of the two lists. The new list should be made with its own memory â€” the original lists should not be changed.

    ```CPP
    Input:  L1 = 1->2->3->4->6->NULL
            L2 = 2->4->6->8->NULL

    Given two singly linked lists of size N and M, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.
    If linked list do not merge at any point, then it should return -1.

    ```CPP
    Input:  LinkList1 = 3->6->9->common
            LinkList2 = 10->common
            common = 15->30->NULL
